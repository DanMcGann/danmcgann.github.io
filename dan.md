## Recent Hikes

### Longs Peak
My first fourteener! Fantastic hike, but the altitude really took a toll.

### Unknown Icelandic Mountain
Beautiful hike in the Snæfellsjökull National Park.
unfortunately all the signs were buried in the snow, so I'm not actually sure which mountain it was.

### Mt. Marcy
A classic of the Adirondacks!
