### Park City (January 2022)
I may have injured my ankle but the skiing was still great!

### Dolly Sods (June 2021)
A really unique spot in WV. Beautiful place to hike in alpine meadows, jut be cautious given the complete lack of trail markers!

### Tuckerman's Ravine (May 2021)
I never thought I would enjoy backcountry skiing, but I'm worried that doing Tucks has me hooked!

### Park City (January 2021)
Always practice with people who are better than you, its the best way to improve.

### Longs Peak (August 2019)
My first fourteener! Fantastic hike, but the altitude really took a toll.

### Unknown Icelandic Mountain (March 2017)
Beautiful hike in the Snæfellsjökull National Park.
unfortunately all the signs were buried in the snow, so I'm not actually sure which mountain it was.

### Mt. Marcy (August 2016)
A classic of the Adirondacks!
