## Recent Hikes

### Longs Peak
My first fourteener! Fantastic hike, but the altitude really took a toll.

### Unknown Icelandic Mountian
Beautiful hike in the Snæfellsjökull National Park.
Unfortunatly all the signes were burried in the snow, so I'm not actually shure which mountian it was.

### Mt. Marcy
A classic of the Adirondacks!
