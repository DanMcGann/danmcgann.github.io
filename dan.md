### Dolly Sods, WV (June 2021)
A really unique spot in WV. Beautiful place to hike in alpine meadows, jut be cautious given the complete lack of trail markers!

### Tuckerman's Ravine, NH (May 2021)

### Park City, UT (January 2021)
Always practice with people who are better than you, its the best way to improve.

### Unknown Icelandic Mountain (March 2017)
Beautiful hike in the Snæfellsjökull National Park.
unfortunately all the signs were buried in the snow, so I'm not actually sure which mountain it was.

A classic of the Adirondacks!
