My name is [Dan](/dan). I am a Ph.D. student in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor Michael Kaess.

My research goal is to develop holistic robot perception that enables robots and multi-robot teams to understand their relation to an environment (State Estimation) as well as provide a deep contextual understanding of that environment (Mapping). Specifically, I want to build perception algorithms that scale to the needs of future applications and are actually deployable in the real-world.

In my undergrad career I worked with Professor Taskin Padir and a fantastic team on NASA's Mars Ice Challenge, and started Northeastern's Chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (NUSEDS).
