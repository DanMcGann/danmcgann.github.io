My name is [Dan](/dan). I am a 4th year senior at Northeastern University studying Computer Science.
My academic interests are in robotics, particularly the use of robotics for space exploration and settlement.

In my undergrad career I worked with Professor Taskin Padir and a fantastic team on NASA's Mars Ice Challenge, and started Northeastern's Chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space ([NUSEDS](https://twitter.com/sedsnu?lang=en)). In the next phase of my career I plan to attend graduate school and push the boundaries of what our robotic explorers can do!
