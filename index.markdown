My name is [Dan](/dan). I am roboticist interested in everything related to robotic state estimation and mapping! I received my Ph.D. in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University with Professor [Michael Kaess](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/) and am currently working as a research scientist at [FieldAI](https://www.fieldai.com/).

My research goal is to develop holistic robot perception that enables robots and multi-robot teams to understand their relation to an environment (State Estimation) as well as provide a deep contextual understanding of that environment (Mapping). Specifically, I want to build perception algorithms that scale to the needs of future applications and are actually deployable in the real-world.

In my undergrad career I worked with Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/) and a fantastic team on NASA's Mars Ice Challenge, and started Northeastern's Chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (NUSEDS).
