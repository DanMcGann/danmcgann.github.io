My name is [Dan](/dan). I am a Ph.D. student in robotics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor Michael Kaess. 
My academic interests are in robot perception, localization, and mapping. I am particularly interested in these topics as they relate to space exploration!

In my undergrad career I worked with Professor Taskin Padir and a fantastic team on NASA's Mars Ice Challenge, and started Northeastern's Chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space ([NUSEDS](https://twitter.com/sedsnu?lang=en)).
